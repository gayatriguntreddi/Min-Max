 <p class="para">Responsive web design (RWD) refers to designing websites to adapt to a user's device. 
    The goal is for a website to retain its optimal usability and appearance regardless of the device it's displayed on. 
    Responsive web design responds to user needs by adapting to different screen sizes, orientations, layouts, and platforms.
     This is accomplished with the use of flexible grids and layouts, responsive images, and CSS media queries.
